Motivation for software
-----------------------

`doit <https://github.com/pydoit/doit>`__ is an excellent package for
creating tasks with e.g., file dependencies and specific targets with
likeness to ``make``. The definition of *tasks*, as they are called in
``doit``, is done by creating a function that returns a dictionary
(``return dict()``) or a generator of dictionaries (``yield dict()``).
This provides a simple interface for creating tasks. However, the
simplicity results in a lot of boilerplate as same file dependencies or
task dependencies are used across different tasks. As the tasks are
defined in ``Python`` code, in a file called ``dodo.py``, there is an
infinite amount of possibilities to reduce this boilerplate and increase
task definition reuse. This package is an attempt at creating a
composeable functional framework for creation of ``doit`` easily
reusable task definitions that are then compiled to dictionaries that
are usable by ``doit`` for task definition.

Running tests
-------------

To run pytest in currently installed environment:

.. code:: bash

   poetry run pytest

To run full extensive test suite:

.. code:: bash

   poetry run doit
   # Add -n <your-cpu-core-count> to execute tasks in parallel
   # E.g.
   poetry run doit -n 8 -v 0
   # -v 0 is added to limit verbosity to mininum (optional)
   # doit makes sure tasks are run in the correct order
   # E.g. if a task uses a requirements.txt file that other task produces
   # the producer is run first even with parallel execution

Formatting and linting
----------------------


Formatting & linting:

.. code:: bash

   poetry run doit pre_commit
   poetry run doit lint

Building docs
-------------

Docs can be built locally to test that ``ReadTheDocs`` can also build them:

.. code:: bash

   poetry run doit docs

doit usage
----------

To list all available commands from ``dodo.py``:

.. code:: bash

   poetry run doit list
